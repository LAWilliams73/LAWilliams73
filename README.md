- 👋 Hi, I’m @LAWilliams73
- 👀 I’m interested in front end development...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css and javascript...
- 💞️ I’ve done NuCamp but did not feel I understood alot, most that I completed and learned is because I 
- would implement and use variations of that code I would find and make it work, then I would help my classmates learn it or would find the bugs in their code
- I am now doing Codecademy and Upskill but still feel that I am not progressing like I want, I want to change careers from a bartender/server so
- people will not look at me or my job as garbage and treat me accordingly, people are not nice to fellow humans in the restaurant business.
- I am now learning github and a little about cmd line Ubuntu...I could use advice and motivation as someone older getting in the field
- 📫 How to reach me ...I guess you can reach me here somehow on github or Professionallw@outlook.com
